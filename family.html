<li><strong> My Big Sister </strong></li>
I have an independent big sister and her name is Nor Farhana Binti Fadzil. She is getting into 26 years this year and she was 
born at the same place as I was born which is Hospital Sungai Petani. My sister is very strict and fierce on her outside but 
inside her heart nobody knows what happend.She study at SMK Pekula Jaya as her last education place and she did have the chance
to further her study because she had to take care of our little brothers. She likely to pretend do not care about her surrounding 
but she is very sensitive and plus, she very meticulous person and did not like see any mess in front of her. She always take care 
of us when me and my siblings little kid because our parent was so busy with work and she the one who take the parent role as she 
nailed it with teach us many lesson that parent should take care of. She work as document manager in SPS Corportation as she just 
start to work there in 2020.

<p>
<li><strong> My Big Brother </strong></li>
My big bro name Muhd Nasran Bin Fadzil, he is the second child of our family. His role is to help my sister to support my family
as he have his own life to take care of. He is 25 years old this year and he just 1 year younger than my sister. He did not like 
studying as he always skip school to work search for money for himself. He very problematic student and always pick problem in
school but many years has passed as he already turn into a good man and decide to help his family. My brother very thoughtful and
kind to everyone as he also can be playful and jockster.

<p>
<li><strong> My Little Sister </strong></li>
Her name is Nur Farah Syamira Binti Fadzil which is a little bit similar to my name as she is younger 5 years than me which makes 
her 16 years old. Currently she studying at SMK Teluk Bayu. She just 16 years old but her height already in 6ft and higher than
our parent and big sister and brother. She really obsessed with gaming and did not like to study. I hope she stop it and study 
to make our parent proud.
</li>
</p>

<p>
<li><strong> My Little Brothers </strong></li>
Lastly, I have two little brother in 12 and 9 years old. They are the last siblings our family and they are very annoying but of course
I love them because they are one of the family member that makes me laugh and happy everyday. They studying at SK Simpor and now the 
school did not open because of the covid-19 case which makes them study at home and I had to tutor them while the teachers give them 
homeworks to them so that they did not waste anytime while stay at home. In other words, Muhd Nazreen and Muhd Naufal was the golden
child and everyone adore them because of their age and sometime they are very off limit due to their figting and bickering which make
my big sister angry and smack them off.

<p>
<li><strong> My Bestfriend </strong></li>
Alia Farhana Binti Jamaluddin was my first best friend in highschool until now which make 9 years of our friendship. She very-very 
dependable friend and always help me whenever i felt down or need shoulder to lean on. She also my partner in crime and parner in
sipping tea whenever we had drama to talk on. She had a very good chemistry with and surprisingly our taste in fashion or food very
differently weird. She always stay with me when i'm at my worst or I pushed everyone out from my life and indeed she special because
she is my first bestie that understood and similar to me. Overall she just like my sister to me because we always glue together and 
until now she stay with me and she also take same course with me in UiTM Kedah but in different class.
