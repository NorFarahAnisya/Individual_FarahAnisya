<h2> MY EXPERIENCE </H2>

<P>
I used to work at library of Khir Johari highschool as library assistance. Besides that, I also work as bakery as assisstance bakery 
with my aunt as homemade bakery as I get many knowledge about pastry food and cake. Moreover, I work about 5 month just to improve my experience
as I continued to work as donut worker at Tf Mart Sungai Petani to do as part time job because I have to add my pocket money.
What I have gain from those work was social skills and effiency in doing the job as it can increase my confident to get into
a intense working environment.
