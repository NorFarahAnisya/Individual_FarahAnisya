<h2> EDUCATION </h2>


<ol>
<li><strong> Middle School - Sekolah Kebangsaan Simpor </strong><br />
I study in SK Simpor when I was 7 to 12 years. This school very close to my house as I always ride my bicycle to school.
In UPSR, I got 2A 2B and 1C which lead me to SMK Teluk Bayu highschool which is very far away from my house.

<li><strong> Highschool - Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Teluk Bayu </strong></li>
In 5 years for studying in this highschool as this school taught me many lesson in education and outside life because when we 
graduate from highschool the reality will hit us like a truck as we have to survive this own world without anyone help but
ourselves. In SPM, I got 4A, 2B, 1C and 1D and I was thinking to further more study to gain more knowledge and I was accepted
in UiTM Kedah for diploma.

<li><strong> University - Universiti Teknologi Mara </strong></li>
This university offer me an easy course that did not involved any numerical study because I really weak in math so UiTM offer 
me Information Management course as I gladly accept them and I already get through them 2 years and half for 5 semester. At 
first, I'm really awkward to get known new friend and social with them but eventually they really being nice to me as I really enjoy
my life as a university student. I really hope to graduate with my friends and on time as i have to pass all subject on this
last semester and work hard.
